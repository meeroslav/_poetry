# Haiku poetry

```
I count with fingers
To open my mind and let
The word stream to flow
```

```
No longer myself
This mask concealing my face
Thirst casts a shadow
```

```
Inhaling the night
Aroma of distant stars
Silently I sail
```

```
Wake up the flowers!
Shiny stars will dance tonight
Just for you and me
```

```
Below silent creek
words flow carrying the sweet
poison of contact
```

```
I have enveloped
night of my story, lone left
behind on a shelf.
```

```
I open and let
Nocturnal window to bring
Kernel of my dreams.
```

```
Wide awaken now
let your razors crawl my skin
cut me wide open
```

```
Find me underneath
Sweep your disbelief, I'm your
Desolated voice
```

```
Look into my eyes
Deep inside the abyss dwells
Scout forever
```

```
Separations merged
Contrapositions agreed
We have unified
```
